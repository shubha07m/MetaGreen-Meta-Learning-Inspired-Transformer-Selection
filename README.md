We developed a metalearning-inspired framework for green semantic communication that optimizes transformer selection based on energy efficiency and semantic fidelity. This work leverages meta-learning techniques to dynamically adapt transformer models
for varying communication contexts, aiming to reduce energy consumption while preserving the semantic integrity of the transmitted data. The approach significantly outperforms traditional methods in terms of both energy efficiency
and semantic preservation.
